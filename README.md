Hey, I'm @Skibbsies.

I'm an avid coder, proficient in Lua and Autohotkey. I'm a hobbyist for coding, with no professional qualifications.
I'm a fan of gaming, especially on Minecraft and Terraria (and I enjoy modding both!). Equally, I may upload some of my content on GitHub in the future, for others.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy your day!
