Hey, I'm @Skibbsies.

I'm an avid coder, proficient in Lua and AHK (Autohotkey). I'm a student, but I don't study anything to do with software, nor hardware, but I enjoy coding as a hobby.
I'm a fan of gaming, especially on ROBLOX, Minecraft and Terraria (and I enjoy modding the last two). Equally, I may upload some of my content on GitHub in the future, for others.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy your day!
